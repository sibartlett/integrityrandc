                <dt>Basement waterproofing</dt>
                <dd>Many people today rely on their basements as extended living space. Others utilize their basements for it’s storage capacity. Whatever the reason, there’s nothing worse than a damp, musty basement or one that has cracks and leaks!</dd>

                <dt>Roofing</dt>
                <dd>A well maintained roof is integral to keeping you and your family dry, and protecting your property and possessions. From small repairs to new installations, we'll ensure that your roof continues to withstand the elements!</dd>

                <dt>Skylights</dt>
                <dd>Allowing more natural light into your home can make a significant difference to the look, feel and value of your home.</dd>

                <dt>Weeping tile installation</dt>
                <dd>Is water leaking into your basement? Sometimes in older homes there never was any weeping tile installed. Weeping tile allows the water near the structure of your home to drain away from your basement to the adjoining land.</dd>

                <dt>Concrete work and restoration</dt>
                <dd>Need a new patio? Or maybe some steps, or a sidewalk? Some restoration? Whatever the job, if it’s concrete work, we’ll do a great job for you that lasts for years to come!</dd>

                <p>Once  again, I want to extend my sincere thanks to you, Byron, for the outstanding work you completed at my home on the roof, chimney and driveway.</p>
                <p>I was thoroughly pleased with your workmanship, expertise, attention to detail and the way you continually kept me informed as work progressed.</p>
                <p>Most of all, what was very important to me, was relying on a company that would diagnose the overall situation and provide me with a clear, concise estimate of the work involved and the cost.</p>

                <p>I appreciated the excellent work you and your team performed. I'm confident the roof will hold up for many years. Your work ethic and professionalism has provided me with peace of mind knowing I chose the correct roofer for the job. The skylights you installed and the trim work inside the home came out excellent. Thank you for completing the entire job as quoted.</p>

                <p>Now that you have done several jobs for my mother, I wanted to take a moment to thank you so much for all of your great work. From big jobs like the new roof to smaller jobs like the various basement leaks and chimney work, we have been very happy with everything you have done. You respond quickly when we get in touch, even on weekends (which is much appreciated when water is creeping across the basement floor!), and stay focussed on us until everything is fixed and very well cleaned up at the end of every work day.</p>
                <p>Because I live a day's journey from my mother, I am particularly grateful for your offers to "give  her a hand at any time" and even to have her call anytime of the day or night if she needs help.  While I hope we never have to take you up on this offer, it gives me great peace of mind to have someone nearby who we trust completely to act in my mother's interest, and who we are very comfortable to leave alone in the house or provide with a key. You have consistently gone above and beyond for us, and I just wanted you to know how grateful we are to have discovered you and your firm.</p>

                <p>My father is a 92 year old man who was very nervous about the job that had to be done in his basement. (Installing weeping tile, removal of panelling, removal of floor tiles etc.) Byron put all of his anxiety to rest with the manner in which he conducted himself both in his work and the way he treated my father and his home with the utmost respect. I have never seen anybody work so hard without complaint, doing the “little” things with the utmost of care and precision. He did all of the work without complaint and doing even more than what was originally contracted. He moved tables and chairs, removed panelling, removed floor tiles, worked in a very clean manner by constantly cleaning all areas where he worked immediately, broke concrete to install weeping tiles, replaced pipes that we initially thought did not replacing. I can go on and on. My father was particularly impressed with Byron’s work ethic. All promises were kept and then some.  As a son, I cannot tell you how much his demeanor and work helped alleviate any concerns I may have had on my father’s behalf. It certainly took a lot of pressure off of me.</p>
